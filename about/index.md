Hey. I'm Shannon.

You have probably seen me around, but it's difficult to put your finger on where. Was it the opening party for a tech conference? Was I hosting karaoke? Maybe it was at that training session with all the cops you had to do for work, or...wait...was I dressed as a puppy? Maybe I was dressed as a puppy, teaching your preschooler impulse control? That's very possible. I used to do that a lot.

I am currently enrolled in the Enfield class of Omaha Code School. I've never done any coding in my life before this moment. I am not still not convinced it isn't magic.

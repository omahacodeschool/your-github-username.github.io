It's Leap Year Day. I would like to think this is the universe's plan to help me catch up, but probably not. The days of Week 4 have run away like wild horses over the hills, to steal badly from a poem by Charles Bukowski. In that week, let the record show I at least made sense out of my swim meet manager program, and got well down the road, though not as far as the aforementioned horses, on a program called "Binary Battle" which randomly sets two contestants of some kind against each other, and the user votes for their favorite of the two.  It is kind of like the Nebraska Caucuses, which my wife and my younger daughter will both be participating in a week from now.

The lessons are slowly moving us from the nether reaches of the coding process, the beloved database and the ways it has to be manipulated in order to make the internet current and relevant. We are moving toward things we see all the time, like drop-down menus, check boxes, user authentication, and users. These things are no less complex than database manipulation, but more interesting because I have seen them in my own internet experiences. I am a visual learner. I have to have it drawn out, and be able to see it. And seeing familiar things was encouraging.

My "binary battle" topic was selection of the best NFL quarterback since the advent of the Super Bowl. The program picks out two of the 15 or so quarterbacks in the database (more can be added) and the user picks This One or That One. It accumulates votes, but of course the voting never ends, just as this debate will never end as long as people watch football. (Watching football may be an activity with an end date, given the new information about the game's dangers, but that's another issue for another blog. 

The audience for this program is sports bars and the barflies therein. If somebody sitting at the bar sits and tinkers with this game long enough to buy another drink, the game pays for itself. The people I hung around with in my previous career would have consumed this topic and turned it into hours of conversation. The people at Code School, probably not so much. (See blog entry "Making Peace with Sheldon Cooper" for more on leaving your tribe.)

The audience for the binary battle project was, originally,  people who were done with the previous project. Eventually, that expanded to everybody. Coding never sleeps at OCS. Speaking of which, I do not remember the last day in which I did not work on code school. But I do remember the first day in a long time when I slept more than five consecutive hours. It was the Friday night/Saturday morning after I finished the simple program to vote on the best NFL quarterback. It's no Nebraska Caucus, but it's done. Done seems to be the best sleep aid.

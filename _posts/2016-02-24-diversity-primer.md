<i> the most depressing thing i get excited about </i>

If you're reading this and are not in the class, the Diversity Primer was a resource to give us as a quick, dirty overview of the diversity (or lack thereof) in this industry we are entering. I'd suggest checking it out, if you're not well versed in this topic, both because it is <i>fascinating</i> and because I'm not going to write an overview of it here.

I could easily let this post get out of control. I have a lot of feelings about this subject, mostly angry feelings with lots of homework-inappropriate profanities. I would gladly, gleefully engage in conversations with you about the patriarchy and/or white supremecy, any day, because it's something I care deeply about and think is important to discuss. But it is not exclusive to this industry. It's just <i>really</i> obvious in this industry. 

A new horror, for me, was retention rates.

Retention rates never really registered with me before. 

Maybe it's this new position I find myself in that made me notice something I hadn't, or maybe I just hadn't heard the statistics. More likely is that now I have context for what it actually means. 

For now, let's ignore the fact that there are financial and cultural barriers to even beginning to learn code. For now, let's pretend that tech being famously composed of white cis-dudes isn't intimidating as hell and potentially driving away talent. Let's pretend, for this very moment, that anyone can get to square zero of learning code.

Learning code is <b>hard</b>. It's emotionally grueling and brutal work. I don't think there's any person in my class who doesn't think so, and everyone I've talked to who is already in the industry---brilliantly clever people---say it's some of the hardest work they've ever done. Rewarding, sure, but hard.

I say that not to complain, but to point out that people who learn code worked their butts off to do it.  

Now imagine that you graduate from OCS or boot camp or a four year computer science course, maybe there's some sacrifices, some debt, but hey! You do it! You do all this work, and you make it! And then, even better, you GET A JOB. 

This is the dream.

(Let's pretend, again, that getting the job isn't harder for people who don't look like, sound like, or act like the people who are already at this job. That your name won't stand in the way of getting an interview, that you don't feel the need to for your interview outfit to make you look as much like a normal, straight white dude as possible.)

(Let's just pretend, for this argument, that isn't an issue.)

You get a job, you do the work, and then two years later, YOU QUIT. Can you even imagine? You quit noot just the job, but the whole tech world. You leave, or you get fired, and you decide not to apply for another position. Not because you can't do it, not because you're bad at it, but because you're different, and it's not worth it to work in an industry where you have to fight <i>just to exist in the industry</i>.

You work so hard, and you overcome all that stuff that we were pretending weren't issues for the sake of this example but are actually, yes, super big issues, and then you make it and you end up quitting anyway. That's the problem with low "retention rates."

There's a very specific string of profanities that can be attributed to that situation, but I'll just use "tremendously unfair" for now.

I often refer to inclusivity as "the most depressing thing I'm excited about." The lack of diversity in tech makes me mad, but this knowledge of our shortcomings is also an opportunity to make things better.  I'm looking forward to the discussions next week, and I've always been very proud of how seriously OCS takes the subject. The coding curriculum here is as much about making you a better member of the industry as it is teaching you Ruby, and I think that making us mindful of diversity is one of the greatest lessons we can take into the workforce with us in the weeks ahead.

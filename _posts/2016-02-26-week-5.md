This week, our major lecture sessions were the user experience--validation, user authentication, accounts, and automatic redirects. We got a new project assignment--an app in which users can create user accounts, and then write to-do lists, each item on which can be designated to another user and be checked when completed. This project was a welcome relief due to its small scale, as I was getting seriously overwhelmed with the quantity of files in my swim meet application. It's nice to be learning these new features on something with less bulk so that it's easier to focus on these new lessons as opposed to organization and the bugs and still-to-be-added features in the swimming app that keep distracting me.

Mentally, I feel like this week went really well, although I was struggling quite a bit from lack of sleep (not because of code school, but just because my body hates me). It excites the hell out of me every time I fix a somewhat-complicated bug because only three weeks ago I would've freaked out and run to Sumeet or Alex for help immediately. Finally feeling self-proficient (although only a little bit; I know I'm still a super n00b at this) is really, really great. Our projects are getting more and more like something I'd expect to use in my real life, especially the to-do application. I'm really looking forward to learning how to make it look presentable as well as functional.

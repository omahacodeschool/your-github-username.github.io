title: Hack Your Learning
---

Hacking your learning can be a tricky concept. How are you supposed to 'hack' anything if you don't know how to get from A to B the hard way? If you don't know yourself and how you learn as an individual, identifying those shortcuts (or 'hacks' as it were) may prove difficult. 

So first step: get cozy with your advantages and shortcomings when it comes to shoving knowledge into your brain. 

Do you need a step-by-step explanation or would you rather review the information as a whole at your own pace? Is information more easily absorbed through diagrams or through a narrative? Would you prefer an oral, visual, or written explanation? The list goes on...

Once you know your ideal medium of information for intake, I suppose next would be environment.

Does having the hustle and bustle of a coffee shop help you to focus or is a monastery-with-a-vow-of-silence type venue more to your liking? Music? TV on in the background? Again, you just need to identiy what fits for you.

Since beginning the Odyssey (another Greek mythology reference, weird) that is Omaha Code School, I don't know if I would say that I've hacked my learning much. Not having been in an academic setting for six years or so, I definitely had to reassess the above. 

For one, while I can process a chunk of information from any given lecture during the lecture, my true learning and understanding doesn't come until I can take that information and go through it again at my own pace. I need to stop and investigate and implement and break and succeed to really get a grasp. Depending on the writing and teaching style of the instructor, a written explanation can either be a blessing or a curse. On the other hand, a diagram, or in this case a chunk of code, has been as reliable as death and taxes for me. Combing through a program from front to back and vice versa has allowed me to really understand how it works in a mechanical sense.

As far as environment, I've kinda forced myself to make it work (insert Tim Gunn voice here). At school, I usually plant myself at a desk and plug away. Sometimes I listen to the music on the speakers, others I listen to NPR or music of my choice on headphones, hell, I'll even just sit with headphones in my ears without any music on at all. At home, I generally work from my couch with Netflix on in the background and whether by choice or not, my cat Gem in my lap. As noted in an earlier post, whether at school or at home, coding has the strange property of making time fly by for me. So time hack, I guess (eat your heart out Doc Brown).

TL;DR: Know yourself and how you best absorb information under whatever particular/peculiar circumstances.

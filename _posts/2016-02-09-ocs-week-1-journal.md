It is my second week of Omaha Code School, and curiosity about the first has set in among my friends. What's it like? What did you learn? Should I send my kid? Should I go myself? Inside that thin but durable scaffolding, I shall build a blog. The goal is weekly updates. In an emergency, there may be a midweek update.

Week 1 - January 25 - January 29

Based on my vast five days of experience, a good day at Omaha Code School feels like autumn. Like a windy, burnt-orange-skied October afternoon. Leaves glide by, effortlessly fascinating. Every leaf is a piece of information I need to know. I grab with the only two hands I have, and gather a few as uncountable others fly past. But they being leaves and all, they will fly past again, and I will have had a little more practice catching them. 

That's a lie. Would that it were true, and perhaps 12 weeks from now it will be. But in my previous career in marketing communications, I got good at describing a slightly better world made that way by whatever we were selling. That's not because of any sinister manipulation by my former employer. It's because we want that slightly better world we see in the sales brochure. We want to be that vibrant retired couple on the cruise, or that extended family eagerly assembling for a non-specific celebration. Thirty years of that kind of writing is a lot of lying, so I ask a forebearance. I might lie. If I see it I will erase it, or apologize for it. If I accomplish anything with this blog, I want to tell the truth. Because if you decide to attend Omaha Code School in small part because of my journal of my experience there, I don't, for once, want to paint a slightly better world than the one we have. 

The first and second weeks of Omaha Code School already blend. I have produced a successful game of rock-paper-scissors and a failed "string segmenter" (not worth explaining), and learned a little about Ruby, methods, arguments, global variables, instance variables, and a small volcano of other stuff that runs together like the input for a string segmenter beforeitismagicallyseparatedintowords and prepares the newbie to meet Sinatra. Sinatra is described by no less authority than Wikipedia as "a free and open source software web application library and domain-specific language written in Ruby. It is an alternative to other Ruby web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Merb, Nitro, and Camping." 

If it sounds like going zero to 60 in a week, that's because it is. At the wheel of this Ruby-encrusted racer are the calm Sumeet Jain, Californebraskan, and his pit crew, daytime TA Alex and alternating night TAs Wendy and Steve. I imagine a one-question interview for the TA position: "Soooo, just how patient are you?"

I test that patience. I am in the new and uncomfortable position of not always getting "it," whatever it is. I have had to get over myself a little bit and make that be okay. Which leads to an early revelation: I have to learn to ask for help. They will give it, but I have to ask. Then I have to show up, and bring my brain with me when I ask for help. You are not going to be told the answer here. Sumeet or Alex or Steve or Wendy may have to draw a mental box all the way around the answer, but you have to get the answer. 

That is a lot of learning for one week. On that score, all is well with Omaha Code School.

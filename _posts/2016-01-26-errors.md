### 1. syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end (SyntaxError)

I was missing an 'end'

### 2. in `require': cannot load such file -- dictionary.rb (LoadError)

'require' only works if you've defined the proper scope of your project

### 3. in `require_relative': cannot load such file -- /Users/beth/Code/ruby-toy__string-segmentation/dictionary.rb (LoadError)

I forgot to add the 'lib' directory to my file structure. I was using ../dictionary.rb instead of ../lib/dictionary.rb

### 4. undefined local variable or method `ilast_letter' for #<String...'

I had an extra character

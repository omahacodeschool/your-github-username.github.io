We've been writing Ruby Methods since before day one, but sometime in the last two weeks their usefulness really clicked for me, and now I both 1. probably write too many methods and 2. I really wish I could just write real world methods for myself.

Oh it'd be heavenly.

There are some learning hacks I've been establishing for myself the last few weeks that are becoming tiny, IRL Methods, little rituals that help me focus, power through, and take care of myself as I throw myself head first into a new, giant project.

<b>Airplane Mode</b>
My phone is my main tool of distraction. Texts and messages from friends, notifications from social media--it's impossible to <i>not</i> look when you hear that little buzz. Now, setting my phone to airplane mode is the very first thing I do before sitting down to work on a problem, and I'm only allowed to turn it off when I'm sitting down to an <i>extended</i> break (if I allowed myself to check it every time I went to the bathroom I'd fall down a text-response rabbit hole.)
Pro-tip: if someone does start a text convo with you during a break, I like to let them know I'm going into airplane mode, and that I'll get their responses in an hour (or whatever). This both lets them know that any silence on my part is to be expected, and sets future expecations for slow responses (when, let's hope, I'm working at a REAL JOB all day).

<b>To Do Lists</b>
Whether it's Issues in github or old school paper and post-its, to-do lists have always been very motivating for me. Now I not only make to-do lists for my homework, but also...sorry...to-do lists for my breaks. I'M BAD AT TAKING BREAKS. I was bad at taking breaks when I worked in retail* and I was bad at taking breaks when I did theatre and I'm still bad at it. But I'm trying.
Really. 
If I have a little list item like "call to make hair appointment" or "play fetch with cat", it doesn't feel as decadent to save my progress and walk away for a few minutes. I'm just working through another list. Maybe someday self care won't feel like cheating on work but, you know, baby steps.

*OCS is actually the first time in over a year where I've regularly eaten lunch. Alex makes fun of me for eating lunch while coding (instead of walking away like a healthy person) but what she doesn't realize is that 90% of my days at my retail management job, the first time I would consume anything other than coffee would usually be after my shift, around 7 or 8 pm.
So this is actually an improvement!

<b>Pavlovian Playlists</b>
I have diverse musical tastes and I'm starting to use those to my advantage. EDM is for creating new work. Lady rap is for troubleshooting difficult tasks. Doom Metal is for repetitive tasks that I'm positive I know what I'm doing. If I really need a boost it's just Beyonce's "Formation." Over and over and over.
Using the same kind of music for the same kind of tasks is a reminder to stay on task, but also works as a comfort mechanism. I'm making new things now. It's gonna have challenges. Or, don't panic, don't panic, I know what I'm doing right now. The playlist says so.

<b>Things I Would Love To Improve</b>
I should take legit lunch breaks. I should learn when to go to bed. I should start asking for help earlier. I should bring some coloringbooks to school. I should sit in my chair more effectively. I should commit FAR more often.

title: Diversity
---

This is a hard one for me. Diversity, that is. It's difficult for me to grasp on several levels, the first being that I am a white male. Let's go ahead and get that out of the way. It's not something I can (or should) hide. So part of what makes the topic of diversity difficult for me to grasp is that, no matter how hard I try, I cannot *completely* understand what it's like to not be me: a white male living in the United States of America. The other part that makes it difficult is that I consider myself to be someone who very much wants to see diversity in all fields, *especially* the one I'm about to enter. So there's a level of frustration and sadness I feel for those underrepresented in this field.

Unless you've been living under a rock, you'll know it's no secret that the tech industry has been under scrutiny as of late for its obvious deficiencies in the arena of diversity. It's not looking pretty (at least not right now). A quick Google search using the keywords "diversity" and "tech" should be all you need to see what I'm talking about here.

The issue is one that is both obvious *and* complex. What I mean, is that the lack of diversity is there. It's not really something you can argue with. That said, the reasons behind the present state are complex and not something that can be fixed easily overnight. At least not from what I've read.

In some cases regarding women, for instance, it seems to not only be an issue with women not getting hired in the first place, but there's also many who point out that women are leaving workplace (in the tech industry) in alarming numbers. This alone shows us that merely making a move to "hire" more women may not get down to the root of the issue. Articles I've read indicate that there are a variety of reasons women leave the workplace, but that a lot of it often comes down to not feeling comfortable.

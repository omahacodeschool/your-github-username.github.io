title: Week Two Letter
---

Dear noobs,

Learning to code a personal decision and not everyone has an affinity for it. If someone is considering OCS they should figure out if it's something they really want to do and not just because it seems like a quick fix to get out of a career rut or because you'll make more money. I don't really have any fears concerning OCS. And I don't really enjoy writing conceptual journal entries like this. I'd much rather be doing something like coding.

Sincerely,
Beth

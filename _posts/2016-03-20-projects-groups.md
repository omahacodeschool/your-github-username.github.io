title: Bringing it all together
---

This week we start in on our first really big projects.  Earlier, when we'd set about crafting a project from scratch it was mostly about building a functional back-end app that carried out a particular function or set of functions using a stripped down framework for the backend and not much to speak of on the front.  Now, we've got the prospect of a fully functional website for actual clients looming.  For added fun, we're going to be learning the Rails framework on the fly.  

Now, while this could be the moment to have a nervous breakdown, I really enjoyed the last time we had a chance to bring everything together and I'm looking forward to trying to do that again now.  This might pose some new problems because we've increased the size of the group.  As such, sorting out how we're going to break up responsibilities will be a bit of a trial.  Not because I anticipate anyone being difficult about it, but because we've not really had a front-end/back-end split as yet.  Due to some of the unease that I've had with JavaScript so far, I think I'll prefer working on the backend, but if we manage to fit another project in before class finishes, I'm thinking I'll try the front-end.

Again, as we work our way through this, I'm struck by how fluid responsibilities and roles seem in this profession.  There seems a real opportunity to grow and flex your abilities as you go.  I haven't encountered that too much thusfar and I'm happy to see it seems an integral part of the path I'm on now.

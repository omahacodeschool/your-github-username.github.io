These are a few things I would say to someone in my position a few months ago:

## Firstly, GO FOR IT. It's not as scary as you think.

## Make frustration your best friend.

On our first day of class we were told that a career in development more or less means being paid to be frustrated. If class is any indication of our upcoming careers, it's so true. But, it's only day six of class, and I'm already learning to deal with it better. Your brain will adapt and slowly be able to work frustrated longer without shutting down.

## You don't have to stress about memorizing everything.

This is one of the things I worried about most during our prep work. While I'm decent at figuring out how things work, I have a terrible memory. In coding, that's totally ok. Google will be your second-best friend (after frustration).

## There's no one right answer.

This is something I'm still struggling with. In development, there are a million right answers, and many times, there is no one solution that's better than the others. Learning how to think through these problems is the most important lesson, even if you (like me) still want it to be like calculus, in which everything has one correct answer and very little variation in how to find that answer. Coding is far more creative, and that's something you'll learn to love about it.

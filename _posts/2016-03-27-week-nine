title: Work continues and the search for work begins
---

We continue to work diligently on our projects and contrary to what I might've expected at the outset, we're doing pretty well.  I find that while I don't always understand all the finer points of the work, actually _doing_ the work is proving to be doable.  I suspect that that will be the norm for me as I move out from code school and off into the job market.  That's not to say that I feel incompetent, but rather that I feel the proportions of the task ahead of me, and they're considerable.  While that might be a bit daunting, it's also expected.  We're all embarking on a new path.  Still, given that we've started talking about the job hunt this week in earnest, we can be forgiven for being a bit twitchy about how we perceive our abilities.  

With regard to that job search, I suppose I'm feeling the same sort of trepidation that I felt about the job search before I found myself in code school.  That's to say, ill at ease.  I'm not very good at marketing myself.  I tend to minimize my abitilies and accomplishments and I have a hard time perceiving my strengths.  I really have a hard time trying to talk up those supposed strengths as a result.  What's worse, I tend to try and cover up all the nervousness I feel by burying the whole mess in a flood of words.  All of this conspires to make me seem somewhat flighty.  I'm looking forward to some of the workshoping we're supposed to do later for interviewing.  If nothing else, it should give me some new things to work on.  

I wish I had more to report this week, but right now I'm just enjoying working on our project and seeing it take shape day by day.  I'm happy to see that for all my doubts, I'm actually contributing.  I just hope this trend continues.

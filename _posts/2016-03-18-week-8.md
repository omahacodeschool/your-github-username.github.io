Week 8 saw the introduction to CSS and front-end design. Our first assignment wasn't at all layout-involved yet; we were coached on text, color, and size-related concepts without having to know how to format multiple objects next to each other. This assignment was, for some reason, extremely difficult for me. I couldn't seem to space things correctly for a good three days--I finally got most of them to work well after going back to work on it again after we were assigned more complicated work.

The second part of our CSS assignment this week was layout related. We learned about floats and clear and lining up boxes in an aesthetically pleasing enough manner that it'd work on a website. I struggled to grasp the concept of float because it seems so contradictory to the logic of columns for me--I'm definitely looking forward to being able to use Flex Boxes a couple of years down the road. Once I did get a basic grasp on the use of floats (...my method right now is basically to float everything left) I had a lot of fun with the New York Times website simulation.

With only four weeks of class to go, it's definitely time to start the job search. I'm putting off the actual application-submission process until we've had our class resume workshop, but I do intend to start surveying my options this week with a few phone calls. My nerves certainly know that it's crunch time!

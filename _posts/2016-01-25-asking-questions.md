WARNING :: DRY / EMOTIONLESS TEXT AHEAD :: WARNING

When first encountered with a problem or exercise, I attempt to break the procedure down to its smallest possible parts. Usually this will take the form of notes in the text editor meant to link each step to a possible piece of code. 

If I don't know a particular method or whatnot, I search online for possible solutions expressing the problem as simply as possible. From here I tend to start writing code, joining the various steps to ultimately reach the end goal. 

Once complete, I test my code, and if it fails, I attempt to identify where the problem lies. This leads to more online searches and tweaking until I resolve the issue. 

If I am unable to reach a solution, I try to at least have a grasp on where I'm succeeding, where I'm failing, and possible next steps. This way I can ask an instructor to provide assistance while actively moving toward the solution myself.

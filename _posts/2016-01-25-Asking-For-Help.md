title: asking for help
---
<i> both as a reminder to myself and as advice for future collaborators

Before you ask for help, TIAS, which stands for <b>Try It And See</b>. It's go-to advice both in school and on the internet, but "tias" is also the Spanish word for <i>aunts</i> so I like to picture all of my aunts at Christmas, not looking up from their card game, saying "Come back once you've tried it." It's very motivating, depending on what kind of aunts you've had.

Before you ask for help, make sure you know what you're actually asking. Articulate using the actual terms that apply. Don't ask "what am I doing wrong?" or "how do I do it?"--instead, explain what you expected it to do, and what it did instead. 

Learn to read error messages. It's possible Ruby is answering the question before you ask.

Learn to google properly. Maybe you're not the first person to ask.

Right before you add yourself to the queue, or post to #help1, or raise your hand--save your work, and scan for typos. Then try it again. One of those things is probably your problem, and it'll be waaaaaay less embarassing to figure that out on your own.

Thankfully, no assignment thus far has been quite as overwhelming as the String Segmenter program assigned on Day 2 (...although it sounds like that might change tomorrow!). We've worked on quite a few toy problems, but, aside from said string segmenter, the only substantial multi-day assignment has been to create a best-of-round rock-paper-scissors game. Thankfully, this was much easier on the brain than the former. 

I feel like I'm doing fairly well picking up the main concepts and procedures from class, but I've been nearly constantly overwhelmed with the sheer amount of details that need to be paid attention to while coding. It doesn't matter if you have ten thousand things written correctly: if you have one mistake, the code won't work. Which would be fine, if that one mistake weren't always hiding from me in plain sight. I've been frustrated with trying to debug these past few days, as I always seem to get stuck for hours on some stupid, tiny mistake when it's the only thing between me and project completion. I like to think I'm slowly getting accustomed to this constant feeling of frustration, but some days it feels like I'll never really get it. We've already heard plenty about imposter syndrome, so I suppose I'm just getting a heavy dose of it early on in the game.

Aside from these usual frustrations and debugging troubles, code school is going really well--the problems we're working now would've looked like Greek to me a few weeks ago, and it's uplifting to think about how much progress we've all made in such a short time. Here's to hoping we'll be interview ready in less than ten weeks (eeeeeeeeek)!

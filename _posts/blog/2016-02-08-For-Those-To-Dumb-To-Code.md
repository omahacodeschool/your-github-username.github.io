  This one goes out to everyone who thinks they are too dumb to code.
   
  Maybe "too dumb" is overly harsh. You would never call yourself dumb. Not out loud. Maybe you say you're "not the right kind of smart" or that your brain "doesn't work that way" or, seemingly unrelated but definitely relevant "I could never do that" (which is weird, because in almost any other situation you would swear there was nothing you could not do).

  And yet, when it comes to this, you think "Nope." You think, "Not me."

  I used to talk to myself that way (and in even less kind ways) all the time. Once I started to recognize that attitude in myself I saw it everywhere, both in how people interact with me now that I'm in Code School and when they respond to the world--the world which, more and more, is telling people they need to learn it. Some people are even starting to equate the necessity of knowing code to knowing how to read, which is very scary to people, even to brilliant people who have great jobs and multiple degrees. The first time you see raw code it can be really, really overwhelming, and more than a little mystical.

  That also might be why, when people ask me "How is school going?" they listen to my answer with the same head-tilted curiosity as if I were going to Hogwarts, like I'm learning magic. 

  Coding isn't magic, guys. It's just learning. Learning and failing and learning why you failed, over and over and over again. Coding is figuring out how to be comfortable while also being frustrated. Coding is existential breakdowns over a typo. Coding is being really good at Google.

  You could do that. You DO that, in other areas of your life. You re-word your google search until it reveals the perfect result. You learn complex boardgames and you get better the second time you play. Your brain is currently storing the intertwining plots of Buffy and Angel and (still) some of the better shortcuts for the reservation software they used at your restaurant job in college. You are not too dumb to code. This is just a new language to in which to learn. It's hard, but not impossible.

  I get it if you don't believe me. I still kind of don't believe myself. I'm sitting here with some projects under my belt that would've broken my dang brain less than two weeks ago, but that doesn't seem to matter. It's easy to forget that progress when you're staring down an error message for the millionth time in a day.

  Fun fact! I might never believe it! This industry is overrun with imposter syndrome! Every time I've lost my mind during prework and classwork, I've gone to my web-devoloper friends and said, when will I get it? When will I know I haven't made a terrible mistake?

  And they say "LOLZ NEVER" or, more kindly, "I'll let you know if I ever feel that way, but I haven't yet." Which is to say: get used to it, kid.

  If we're gonna make this work, you're going to have to learn to accept that feeling, maybe even embrace that feeling, and you're going to have to unlearn that failure is bad. It's a part of your life now! Every day! Forever!

  And it still doesn't mean you're dumb!

  What's dumb is not trying something because you don't want to fail. What's dumb is not willing to take the steps required to get out of the career that is taking you nowhere. It's dumb to keep doing what you know isn't working when something that could work is possible for you.

  This is possible for you.

  You aren't dumb. You're scared. It's not a particularly positive distinction but you can POWER THROUGH scared. You can make scared work. But only if you want to.

  I'm not saying you HAVE to, I'm just saying you CAN. You CAN. Because you're already exactly the right kind of smart for this. Your brain works exactly the way it is meant to. You have to be willing to look dumb and feel dumb to reap the rewards of being so, so, so very not dumb.

  Also I lied earlier. Coding is kind of magic. When my code succeeds, that feels AMAZING. A-MAZ-ING. Jump on the table and dance amazing. It will all feel worth it, for that tiny success. You will feel brilliant, in that moment. And that feeling, too, I've heard, never goes away.

Hacking my learning is really an exercise in hacking the learner. 

I never had to think about how I learned growing up. I just did it. Now, as seemingly everything in OCS flies by more quickly than I can grasp it, I have to think about how I learn. Turns out I am not that young version of me anymore, and I kind of hate him for not seeing this coming and preparing us for it. 

I have arrived at five fatal errors that will shut down my learning process:
1. Comparison
2. Looking Ahead
3. Distraction
4. Fatigue
5. Low Self-Esteem

Together these can create an infinite loop of not learning. I'll look at the pieces. 

1 Comparison. 

I feel as though virtually everybody in class is progressing more quickly than I am. The human reaction is to blame the work. (Pat to self: Is my life really ruined if I don't have a functioning string segmenter?) As much as I like my classmates, I may be better off not knowing how far along they are, or where I would rank if the binary battle project was applied to the class. So first I turn off Slack. (I assume that people posting giphys of cats in costumes are done with the project, or at least they are so certain about their ability to get done in short order that they don't need to be working at it right now. I don't begrudge them the fun of doing that and do not want it to stop. But as long as I perceive myself as failing I have to get away from it.) Next I leave the building for a quiet place in an undisclosed location. In fact, some of the places I have gone may not be any more quiet than the OCS classroom, but nobody there is working four steps ahead of me on my project.

2. Looking Ahead. 

In 30 years of corporate life, the real production goal, seldom if ever achieved, was an empty inbox. To be caught up. In my academic life, I was always caught up, and that felt great. Now that I am not caught up, looking ahead is like renting anxiety. If all I have to do to take a small victory lap is to write a form that will feed a line of data to a table and display a success page, it may be mildly frustrating that I need to get help sorting out how to do that, but I'm OK. If all I have to do is resolve errors in my swim meet program, add a couple of missing pieces to the program, tom doc, make up tests, complete the binary battle project that everybody else is already on andbythewayjournalentries by Monday, there's a certain amount of throw my hands in the air like I just don't care. 

3. Distraction. 

This is kind of self-explanatory. Yes, things that are easy to do (look at cat photos) distract me from things that are hard to do (write code). It's not a function of the inherent interest, as I am not that interested in cat photos. This one is something I recognized before OCS, in my writing career. Writing, from procedures to poetry, though I like it and feel like I am good at it, is hard to do. I get away from distractions when I do it. Maybe its an INFP thing.

4. Fatigue. 

When I talked to people about Code School, I said my biggest worry going in was just stamina, and just keeping up. I had heard about 12 hour days. Fatigue is real, but for me at least it is not primarily a function of time. It's a function of energy expenditure. It takes a lot more energy to try to do something if I lack confidence and/or the toolset, which is the case right now with coding. If I know what I am doing and I am doing what I know, and I can see progress toward something I want to complete, I can work for long stretches of time without fatigue. So on an individual work level, taking a break every x minutes is not necessarily the solution. Taking a break every x failures, or after x minutes without typing something, comes closer. Better still would be to know my own mind and body well enough to take the right breaks. If I have to try to remember what I am doing, or the code just looks like runes, or I am not thinking about the work and just thinking about not getting the work done and what a fraud I am and (insert cascade of faults and shortcomings here) it's time for a break. 

And burnout is real. I am no expert, but I have experienced it before. I would say burnout is the eventual consequence of ignoring fatigue. It is metastasized fatigue, spreading from wondering how to proceed to wondering why to proceed. 

"Powering through" sounds like a noble, American response to fatigue. But powering through what, exactly, and how, and toward what end?

Low self-esteem. I don't know the components of low self-esteem, or how engrained it gets. Maybe it is enough to think that if the previous four steps were objects in an each do loop, low self-esteem would be the output. 

Here are the steps I am taking to avoid the aforementioned fatal errors.


1. Replace the competition model with the exchange model.

I am not in a competition at OCS. I am a customer of OCS. Omaha Code School has objectives it wants to accomplish, and rearranges its teaching methodology and project list for every session to try to get better at those objectives. My objective, ultimately, is to acquire some new skills that will help me re-enter the workforce. I might not get everything done in the OCS program, but I do want to have completed sensible learning objectives that will get me back into the workforce, and graduate from OCS. For some of my classmates, this may be the path to their first full-time gig, they know with certainty that they want that full-time gig to be coding, and they may have done a little coding before. Those students are all-in and will do every bonus step. I have a long history as something else, and while coding is interesting, especially when it works, I am not sure I want to undo that history so completely when simply enhancing it might be my best ticket.  

2. Avoid looking ahead by refocusing on getting a small win every day. Maybe two. 

Back in the day, my previous employer had a management-candidate test just called the In-Box Test. The most successful taker of the In-Box Test would be somebody who started with the piece of paper at the top of the in-box, and worked their way down, only touching each item once. 

I believe the purpose of the In-Box Test was to measure efficiency in distributing work. It is, for me, the approach it looks like I need to take with Code School assignments. Look at the current one. Break it down into little steps. Complete as many steps as I can in the time I have. Mild celebration for completion of a step. Don't pick up the next thing in the in-box unless and until the current project is done, or the time is up. Getting something done, whatever it is, feels better than strategizing or panicking about what is not done.

3. Own up to my self-contradictory learning style with the following procedure: Get out of OCS to work on the parts of the assignments that I think I can do. Come back to OCS and seek help with things that don't add up for me. One of the reasons OCS is better than, say, an online class, is the help from other humans, including the other students. So when I leave OCS to work, I know I need to find my way back into the classroom sometime.

Figuring that out was like writing a method, I suppose. Get out of OCS. Purchase the noise reduction headphones soon. (I am surprised at just how many of my classmates have them. I thought it would be odd to need them.) Even the trips to Aromas end up being social events, so if I want to get something done I will avoid that siren song and go find an empty table in a secluded place with a nearby power outlet. I still go to Aromas, but I know I am going there to talk.

4. Take a break, more or less on my own terms.

I am not saying get up and walk out on a lecture. "My own terms" include getting any help I can get from the lectures and/or one-on-one work with the TAs. But take a break abecause burnout is real. In the morning on Sunday, February 21, knowing I had multiple assignments to complete, some of which I had not started, I could not make myself open the lid of the laptop. It was time to do something else. 

5. Self-esteem is a long-term project. 

This is not a "hack" issue. There's something else going on here, and I need to get to the bottom of it. I am way too willing to accept something like being turned down for a job as saying much more about me than that I was turned down for a job. But I can hack a way to deal with it during Code School, just as I have probably hacked my way around it all my life.

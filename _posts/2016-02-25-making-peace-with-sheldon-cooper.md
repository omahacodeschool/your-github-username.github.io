Some background, for what could be a delicate prompted writing about diversity in coding: 

1. I am the only person like me in my class of 18 at Omaha Code School. 

2. Before Omaha Code School I had no background in coding, which seems to put me behind many of my classmates. 

3. The Nebraska Department of Labor paid my tuition for Omaha Code School with money from a grant it got from the federal government. Includes laptop allowance.

4. My contact at the Nebraska Department of Labor has indicated he will help me find work after I complete Omaha Code School. But if I fail, I need to pay back the money the Nebraska DOL has paid OCS in my name.

And no, I am not black. I am not hispanic. I am not female, nor am I a military veteran. While everybody in my class probably has a way to say "I am the only person like me in my class," in my case I am the only one old enough to be an AARP member. I am as stereotypically "white progressive Baby Boomer" as it gets. A Whole Foods, 401(k), craft beer, Tom Hanks movies, Dilbert comics, non-GMO everything, Steven Colbert, NFL including fantasy football but internally conflicted about the concussions, Seinfeld episodes whattya mean David Bowie is dead white guy, that's me.

If anything, 57 year old white males are over-represented in important parts of the workforce. Not in coding, where the Stack Overflow 2015 survey of developers shows an average age of 31.6. for U.S. developers, and as low as 25.0 in India. Nevertheless, my potential barriers to entry into the coding are being lowered, and so many other people's are not. 

My barriers to entry are: 1) economic, and 2) ability to learn coding. Ability to learn coding is on me, and the results so far are mixed but kind of encouraging. Set that aside. I am asserting that if the only barriers to entry into this career were economic, what the Googled articles rather condescendingly call the "problem" of hiring women and minority candidates into the coding workforce would have been solved long ago. (I'm not saying for a second that money should not be allocated to increasing the number of women and minority coders. I am saying money plus something else is necessary.)

To steal a thought from a white colleague at my previous employment, if you can pay your way out of a problem, you don't really have a problem. 

To get a look at my perception of the real problem, meet the remarkably unreal Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper, theoretical physicist and lead character on CBS' The Big Bang Theory. He, like me, is a stereotype: science geek, child prodigy (entered college age 11), book smart to the point of casual arrogance but correspondingly socially awkward, comic books, Star Trek, doubly socially awkward around women, OCD played for laughs with his insistence on doing laundry at 8:15 on Saturday night and assorted other quirks. His roommate Leonard, his friends Raj and Howard, and his love interest Amy (met through some online matchmaking service) are all brilliant scientists.

And nobody would want to be them.

While Big Bang Theory is not about web developers, these characters just as easily could be web developers, or actuaries, or engineers or virtually any STEM-related occupation where good-paying jobs go begging and women and minority candidates go missing. 

It's not that women and minorities don't want good-paying jobs. It's not that they can't do the work. (Marvelous irony: The aforementioned love interest Amy is a Ph.D. neuroscientist. Mayim Bialik, who plays Amy, has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.) My theory is that they don't want the life, or at least their perception of the life. They don't want the all-nighter, living on Doritos and Monster, comic-con, superhero movies, social neanderthal brogrammer width and length and depth of it, where sunlight-deprived man-boys code to make a good living, then code as a hobby, then crash when the Monster wears off and fall asleep on a Dorito-encrusted mattress on the floor and dream in code about coding. That life. 

You may wonder where the hip-hop coders are working. Or you may wonder where the coders are who you can talk to about RAGBRAI or documentaries at Filmstreams or the par 5 at Quarry Oaks or vegan recipes or reiki or football or you You YOU! Where can you work with the coders who leave work at 5, sometimes work from home, or have the freedom to slip away for a couple of hours when their kid is getting some award at school?  

I am reminded of a character in a play I just saw, Cloud 9. Cloud 9 seeks to disrupt patterns of thinking to help us recognize oppression. All of the characters (except for one white male) are "miscast." For example, Clive and Betty are husband and wife in a plantation-like British colonial outpost in South Africa. Betty is always played by a male. Similarly, Joshua, ostensibly a black servant of Clive, must be played by a white actor. 

Joshua's situation has currency here. Clive sees himself as having brought Joshua to the plantation and raised him more or less like his own son. Joshua reminds us throughout Act 1 that whatever "people" he was born into, they are not his people and they are bad. Later, an uprising among people, presumably slaves, working at the plantation has resulted in a slaughter. Even at that moment, Joshua grimly asserts that those (the slaughtered) are not his people, and they are bad.

I will not pretend like I know something about what it would be like to be the Joshua equivalent in a world of white coders. But is that it? Do black people feel like they would have to turn their back on their identity in order to be taken in by a very white coding world? That they would face the double learning objectives of learning to code and learning to be a white male, and a geeky white male at that? Is it a kind of colonialism to say that even a well-intentioned geek community that seeks to show an outsider how to fit in, may be showing that outsider that whoever they were before they got here will have to leave now.    

I can feel those questions, a little. The gulf between me and the statistically average 31.6 year-old programmer is not nearly as great as the gulf between a coding team and and even a whole corporation and its only black coder, or only female coder, or only (fill in the blank) other coder. I feel those questions more strongly about whatever my next stop is than I do at Omaha Code School. For large portions of my days at Omaha Code School, I do not feel 57. I am just a student. I never feel 57 while socializing with people from OCS, even and especially at a "board game bar" called SpielBound that I had never been to before OCS. In my previous life I worked a block away from it and parked across the street from it, but it might as well have been in a piranha-guarded bunker underneath the bed of the Missouri River, accessible only if you know the incantation. Turns out the people in that board game bar, at least the ones I know from OCS, are individually interesting, full of welcome and really smart. I have found the ones to whom I can brag about my kids. I have not found the ones who talk sports, but that's ok. Sports talk is available to me elsewhere. I am being met much more than halfway. Which brings me, after exhaustive yakking, to my answer to the dearth of women and minorities in coding. Throw money at the problem, yes. But throw acceptance, too. 

I use "acceptance" rather than "inclusion" pointedly. I see acceptance as taking people as they are, and inclusion as making people into who you are. I have the healthy hybrid of being accepted, with an open invitation to be included. I am enjoying my degree of inclusion, but it is my choice, and not everyone would choose it.

Which brings me back to Sheldon Cooper, who, for all of his quirks, has established his "normal." What I mean by that is that he doesn't have to feel odd being who he is, where he is. The characters on the show accept his quirks. One of his downsides, sometimes played for laughs, is his inability to be equally generous with people who are not like him. (Or really, people who are not exactly him.) People who have a different normal. If the Sheldon Coopers of the world are hiring coders, all looking in the same places for people with the same normal, there will always be a shortage of coders. If there is a way to welcome me and make room for my normal, and somebody else utterly unlike me and their normal, and so on, then the shortage of coders becomes just a money problem. And if you can pay your way out of a problem, you don't really have a problem.

To explore diversity and inclusion issues in a situation perhaps less emotionally charged than workplaces and careers, I thought the article below was well-written and useful. It's about craft beer.

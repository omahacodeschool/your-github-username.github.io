title: Walking to New Orleans
---

Code never sleeps. Neither does Omaha Code School, at least not for a modest spot of bother like snow. Omaha Code School ("OCS" hereinafter) follows the lead of Omaha Public Schools ("OPS hereinafter") on snow days. OPS canceled classes Monday and Tuesday because of snow, as did OCS, sort of.

"Snow day" for OCS means remote learning. A GotoMeeting setup, GitHub and a team channel on a social media app called Slack mean Sumeet can talk to 20 or so people about today's topic. Later, the Slack app and a screen-sharing program conspire to provide periodic 1-on-1 project help from Sumeet or TA Alex. 

During the Tuesday GotoMeeting event, I received an email from Fitbit. (I did not read it until after the GotoMeeting, of course.) Fitbit was breathlessly excited to inform me that in the calendar year 2015 I walked 897 miles. The average Fitbit user got somewhere in the 600s. 

Diligent use of my Fitbit Zip, and an app called Map My Walk, helped me lose 50 pounds during my Summer of Recovery, which started May 22, 2015 and continued through the warm part of the fall. The Zip, the entry-level product in the Fitbit line, counts your steps and approximates your miles. Map My Walk follows you around, and, as the name suggests, makes a map tracing the path of your workout, which you can post if you like. 

Out of curiosity, I wondered how far walking 897 miles would take me. With no more prompting than a Google search on "900 miles from Omaha" a website called timeanddate.com informs me that walkin' to New Orleans, as Fats Domino once sang, is a mere 846 miles. Farther east along the Gulf, Pensacola, Florida is 892 miles away. Walking the opposite direction, I would have arrived at a point 8 miles south of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan by December 31. Eight miles out of Saskatoon in late December does not seem like a great option. 

Fats Domino kind of got less play than he deserved there. Walking to New Orleans, a pretty good hit for a great entertainer, was recorded in 1960, on the Imperial record label. Bobby Charles wrote the song specifically for his hero, Fats Domino. Domino had previously recorded another Bobby Charles song, and on the occasion of a performance in Lafayette, Louisiana, invited Charles to his dressing room. Domino regretted that he did not have a copy of the recording, and said Charles should stop by when Domino was back home in New Orleans. Charles said he did not have a car and would have to walk. The thought of that stuck in Charles' mind, and as the story goes, he wrote "Walking to New Orleans" in 15 minutes. 
 
I only know this because of Wikipedia. If I let it be amazing, it amazes me that Fats Domino, the distance from Omaha to New Orleans, the most distant location from Omaha on earth (Amsterdam Island, French Southern Territories, 12,017 miles away), the route of a 9.7-mile walk I took on a 102-degree day during the Summer of Recovery, the means to achieve a conversation and screen-share with TA Alex, and an email from Fitbit about my summer walking habit all sit out on the internet, in easy reach. 

Back in OCS mode, I struggle mightily through this week's assignments,refactoring and debugging my Rube Goldberg-ish programs and making them into more object-oriented programs with the help of the infinitely patient TA Alex. I am reminded that while I try to learn the how of the internet I don't want to lose the wow of the internet. It would not be a bad outcome for my experience at OCS if I became the coder equivalent of Bobby Charles, reveling in that time he heard Fats Domino on the radio, singing that song he wrote. 


Sincerely,

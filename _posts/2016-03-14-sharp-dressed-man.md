title: Sharp-Dressed Man 
---

During week 7, the bobsled that is Omaha Code School careened through an S-curve and built up speed for the final straightaway before the finish. Pair programming, refactoring, introduction to Javascript, the DOM, html a couple of projects, and recording ourselves talking about refactoring. 

The bobsled analogy sticks out as unexpectedly inappropriate, as winter seems to be in full retreat this week. A 75-degree afternoon awaits the Enfielders who complete the coding assignment with the speed and precision of a bobsled driver taking the perfect line.

As good Nebraskans, we have trouble fully enjoying the gift of a warm day in early March. Especially right now, with the beer and cholesterol of a hundred lenten fish fries coursing through us, we need not be Catholic to think we are going to pay for this somehow. A hot dry summer, perhaps. Tornadoes. Locust invasion. Flooding. Bad football. All of these at once. Here at OCS, our warm day is paid for with a new language to learn: Javascript.

Javascript is the sharp-dressed man of coding, showing a little bit of faded glory (I'm talking about you, pop-up windows) but an overflowing bag of fashion, and it ain't goin' nowhere until every hair is in place. One missing semicolon, a curly bracket that needs a close parenthesis after it, and the only part of this program you are going to read is the error message on the console.

"Clean shirt, new shoes,
And I don't know where I'm goin' to.
Silk suit, black tie,
I don't need a reason why-ee-aye."

Sharp-Dressed Man goes on to be, surprise, sexist to a degree that probably has fueled whole internet bulletin boards full of righteous fury. And you can find those bulletin boards because of Javascript. 

One of my classmates described Javascript as "event-based programming" and that works for me. You, as the internet user, do stuff that causes Javascript to spring into action. Fetch this web page. Or, more nefariously, at the sound of the mouseclick or the nonchalant upside of a keystroke, an "event listener" wakes up and immediately completes a variety of assignments. It may be as simple as congratulating you on providing a correct answer on a quiz, or as complex as capturing a level of detail about your internet wanderings that even Santa Claus does not need to know. 

On the more redemptive side, Javascript does cool stuff. It is right to say, "All eyes will be on me," because, well, they are. If you are going to write front-end code that the user actually interacts with, the coding language war is pretty much over. Javascript is on every browser. So here we are at OCS transitioning from mildly comfortable Ruby to Javascript, even as we transition from the "back-end" work at the top of the bobsled run to the "front-end" work approaching the finish line. 

The first project, several versions of which we will do to get familiar with Javascript coding, is a simple quiz game. I use "simple" as an accurate expression of how an internet user might see it. In the reality of a coder with two days of experience with Javascript, there are no simple projects. It is a victory of sorts that as of this writing my quiz game code is far enough along that I was able to make it less functional, so that I had to look up a previous avatar of it in GitHub that worked better. That means I had accomplished enough to have something to degrade.  

About that "finish line" thing. A bobsled team, acting as one and having done what it can do at the top of the hill, keeps its head down as it approaches the finish line. Head down works for me as we begin to approach our finish line. I have thought about the kind of career I might succeed in post-OCS, but Week 7 Friday happy hour is the first time I could hazard a whisper about what comes next. I have been too busy to think about the concrete steps of the job hunt. On Sunday, I took a few minutes to examine my outdated resume to see how I might incorporate the skills and information I extracted from OCS into this Summary of Working Me. Faster than I realize, OCS courework will end, and I will again be a sharp-dressed man in an interview suit. I like to think, though, that I will know where I am going to.

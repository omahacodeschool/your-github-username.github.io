We've finished our eighth week at Omaha Code School, which means we've only got a month to go. I may have said this last time, but... whoa! (I say that in my whispery, Keanu Reeves voice, of course.)  So much to do and so little time to do it! 

I can honestly say that my fears and self doubt get a little better each day. I am getting more and more comfortable with those things that I once found to be quite overwhelming. It has been a process of demystification, methinks. One of the things that makes Omaha Code School stand apart from the alternatives is how it helps you think. It seems to be to be so much closer to the way the real world works. I mean, does anyone actually go through life having to memorize answers to specific questions only to be tested on them later? Other than school and college, I can think of very few scenarios where this is how things work. 

So instead of memorizing and cramming a bunch of specifics into our heads about Ruby or JavaScript, OCS helps you come to terms with the fact that in the real world, we're very likely to encounter changes and new things - new frameworks, new/updated languages, new anything - and we need to be ready to know what to look for when we are confronted with these new things. If we have a good understanding of how to build from the ground up using "systems thinking", combined with our current hands-on experience with just "doing" this kind of stuff, we can better adapt to the inevitable changes down the road.  

I can also say that the more I learn, the less I know. I mean, there's just so much out there! It's mind-blowing, really! I used to let this overwhelm me (I still do sometimes), but as I just stated above, this is exactly the kind of stuff for which OCS aims to equip its students. 

Because we deal with so many aspects of web development, I find it interesting how most students are already discovering which parts like they enjoy the most (or the least) and which parts come easier (or harder). In week eight we continued with some JavaScript, but began focusing on learning CSS (CSS is what allows us to decorate webpages and give it a more interesting layout).I haven't had enough experience with CSS yet, but I'm already pretty certain that it's not my strong point. In this case it's not that I don't enjoy it, I find it fun to tinker around with. We'll see how I feel about it in a few weeks though.

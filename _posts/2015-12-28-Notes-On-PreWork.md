<i> Sumeet has asked that we document some of our feelings, frustrations, and successes as we work through our pre-class work

WHAT I HAVE FELT/LEARNED DOING CODE SCHOOL PREWORK HAVING NEVER CODED ANYTHING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE

1. Frustrated, all the time. Crying, most of the time. 

2. Asking for help is not giving up, UNLESS you are only asking because you gave up and you want someone to hand you the answer, which no decent person who wants you to succeed will do.

3. GOOD NEWS--Everyone thinks it is hard. Your soon-to-be classmates have said as much on github. Do not worry that maybe when other people say "It's hard" they mean a less-hard-than-it-was-for-you kind of hard. Take some of that dynamite confidence you feel in the other areas of your life and let it leak into this one. Please.

4. It's almost always a typo. If it's not a typo you probably didn't save it.

5. There's this story that's very popular amongst theatre people: Once, the great actor Lawrence Olivier was in a play, and he and another actor were onstage together when they both forgot their lines. (If you've never been onstage, this is a horrifying situation which is the stuff of actor nightmares) The two just stood there for a moment in awkward silence, until Olivier remembered that, on a bookcase on the set, where there was a copy of the script! (Lucky, right?) So Olivier walks over, takes the script, turns to the scene they are in, reads it, and puts it back. Then he turns to his fellow actor and just says, "It's not MY line."

I think about this story a lot when I'm on Stack Overflow.

*Unfortunately no amount of googling "Lawrence Olivier is a jerk" can confirm any of the details of this (possibly made up) story.

IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY FROM ALL PREWORK: sometimes your original thought on how to solve the problem WAS WRONG. Don't bash your head into a brick wall trying to get your first instinct to work when another way might be out there. It might even be a BETTER way! THIS ALSO APPLIES TO YOUR LIFE BUT WE CAN GET TO THAT LATER RIGHT NOW APPLY IT TO CODE.

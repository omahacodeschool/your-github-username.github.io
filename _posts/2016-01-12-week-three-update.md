title: OCS: Week 3 Update
---

Week 3 was an intense one. On Tuesday we got an assignment to create a database and database maintenance website for a swimming competition. While the work isn't mind-blowingly difficult, there's a huge amount of it, and when there's such a big volume of code, there's a much higher potential for things to go wrong. And when it sometimes takes me hours to find and fix an error, just debugging can take so much time that it seems like I'll never get this project done by Tuesday (I'm still not convinced that I will). 

I'm very overwhelmed by the amount of files in my project; I feel like I'm constantly opening the wrong one and getting confused about what is where. Hopefully my organizational skills will fall into place once I get a better grasp on this. 

There are a few aspects of our database maintenance that I really struggle with; I'm still not totally sure when something can be in the controller and when it needs to be a method in the model. And there have been rogue pound signs showing up on some of my web pages. Imagining that's not a good thing? Hopefully I can get some of these errors ironed out (and finish two more massive steps to the project) by tomorrow, when it's due. Yikes.

This Thursday was the first time I've stayed at class til 8pm and still came home feeling like I'm drowning. I have heard that our class is faster-paced than they have been before, but I've also heard that the pace gets progressively faster throughout the class itself, which terrifies me. At times I feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water--I've found myself forgetting how to do super simple things that we learned in the prep-work or in Week 1 because my peabrain doesn't know how to store so much new information in such a small amount of time. From talks with classmates (and past OCS grads), I know that I'm not alone in this at all--it's normal to feel overwhelmed in this class (and in this field in general, I'm starting to realize).

Aside from my usual stress-case worry-warting freakout sessions, it's super cool that we're able to do something like this after only three weeks of class. A friend has started sending me development intern job listings in Omaha, and it excites the hell out of me that I'll be able to start applying for some of them before long. Hooray for adulting!

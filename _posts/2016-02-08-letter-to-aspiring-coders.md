title: Letter to Aspiring Coders or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Code
---

One of my greatest struggles has been identifying a path. With interests spread far and wide, trying to pick one to pursue as a career felt impossible. I'd start researching one career, then another, and ultimately creating some kind of obstacle or reason why I couldn't or didn't want to move forward with any one option. 

Like the proud, albeit obstinate, Gudetama: the call of my comforting shell's siren song was too strong.

Those career and personality tests began to become my compass, some for better but most for worse. While I was gaining insight into my strengths and whatnot, I wasn't making any progress. Ultimately I was left with what I already knew: that I wanted to pursue something that would allow me to exercise problem solving, creativity, abstract thinking, and the like. Bingo. Coding.

  I looked into the plethora of online courses and even applied for Omaha Code
School once before but again found myself creating reasons not to commit. With a quick search online you can find a number of articles bemoaning the boon of similar schools across the nation and how this wave of new programmers is just a trend and that actually kickstarting a career in this manner is more than a longshot. A reason to confirm unfounded fears and not commit? You know me too well, internet. So a year passed and the reasons to stay in my safe (read: stagnant) zone had worn paper thin and I couldn't deny any longer that I was lying to myself. That's when I came back to the Code School.

  For once I forced myself into a commitment. I told myself that even if I
hated it, I could stick it out, find a job, pay off the investment relatively quickly, and begin the soul searching all over again. But within the first couple days of Code School I knew that I had made the right decision. The challenges of rewiring how you think through problems, the reward of forging your own path to solutions, sharing the struggle with others, this feels right. I finally feel like I'm testing my strengths and weaknesses and applying myself unlike I have in quite some time. 

  Hours will pass as I work through an algorithm and at the end of the day I
feel energized even if I'm stuck. One recent triumph has been refining the Rock Paper Scissors program. While ultimately simple in function, I love how it works under the hood. I can't wait to look back on it a few months from now and shudder at how clunky it is and realizing any number of different ways I could have gone about it. I look forward every day to a new challenge and that's really what I've been searching for all this time.

  Now back to you, the reader, the aspiring developers behind those glowing
screens. If any of this sounds familiar and you're standing at a fork in the road, just make a decision. Recognize your strengths and weakness honestly. Find what makes you excited to wake up in the morning. Do your research and if you find all paths leading to coding just give it a go. It won't be easy and you may have to break your brain but you definitely won't be unsure about your decision. Like many things in life, you don't truly know what is for you and what is not until you try.

  That's it for me. Off to create more buggy code with illusions of Zero Cool glitching in my head.

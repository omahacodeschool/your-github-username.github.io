Week 3 (and much of week 4, it turns out) the Pied Piper of South 13th Street, Sumeet (more on that later) has turned our attention to databases, the far-from-glamorous dynamos that power so much of the internet with their rows and columns of data. Sumeet says much of web development is manipulation of databases. 

Fortunately, databases make sense. Our first assignment was to attempt to map out the kinds of information we might need to keep in database form to re-create Facebook, Twitter, a blog or even the bare-bones operation of an imaginary bank. This gave me an excuse to spend a lot of time looking at Facebook, Twitter, a blog called Crooks and Liars, and other hard-core techademic fare. 

During this assignment, I received one of Facebook's clockwork birthday notices. It's Steve Jackson's birthday. (Not his real name.) Write something on his Timeline. Steve, a great guy with a win-you-over social manner, would have loved to have received a message on his birthday. But Steve Jackson, at least the one I know, is dead. 

Have I mentioned in this blog that I am 57? I am at the leading edge of the process of burying my friends. And by attending Omaha Code School, I am also at the leading edge of burying my previous relationship with technology. Which brings me to the Pied Piper of South 13th Street, Sumeet Jain.

You probably know the Pied Piper story basics, but here it is just in case. The Pied Piper of Hamelin rids the village of Hamelin of rats. He mesmerizes them by playing on his magical panpipes, and they follow him out of the village. Things take an unfortunate turn when the village refuses to pay for this service. The Pied Piper exacts his payment by again playing his magical panpipes, this time leading the children of Hamelin out of the village. In one version, these children settle in Transylvania. "Pay the Piper" is the distilled wisdom from this story.

The Pied Piper of South 13th Street does not live in plague-infested medieval Germany, and so has a smaller mission: To rid Omaha Code School of mice. The lecture has gone out to the class: Don't use a mouse. They slow you down, they are clunky, they may carry the bubonic plague. Be like the cool kids and use a combination of the touchpad and keyboard shortcuts. 

It is a lecture to one person. There is only one mouse-user in class. So Wednesday, February 17, 2016, for the first time, I worked through the entire day without using a mouse. I know I reached where the mouse ordinarily would be several times, but succeeded only in doinking the tabletop with the slightly curled fingertips of my right hand. The mouse was still in my laptop bag, it's battery removed in a ceremonial act of muricide.   

The computer mouse, at 40-plus years old, is not quite old enough to be a Baby Boomer, but is plenty old enough to be in the Museum of Dead Technological Stuff Baby Boomers Used. There's room for it right there on an eye-level shelf, next to the dot-matrix printer with tractor-fed paper, the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer (my first work computer, incidentally), and the subscription to America Online, first 30 hours free. 

You've got mail, AOL told us, circa 1995. But in 1995, email was still newfangled. And we, simultaneously giddy about and fearful of the new toy, didn't know what to do with it. My 401k worries would be over I had a dollar for every time somebody in my corporate life sent me an email and then breathlessly called immediately to see if I got it. Or sent me an email that just said, "Call me." Or printed out every received email for closer perusal, and dutifully filed their printed emails in a matrix of labeled manila folders. 

Just to be clear, I am not claiming any high ground. I was no better. The only reason I took myself out of that picture is because email gave me an alternative to the phone. Give me a way to cut down my phone calls, and I will take it on faith that it works.

That wary relationship with technology, that, "If I click this link, I hope I don't give somebody access to my credit card and send a satellite careening toward Earth" vibe, may be dying with the Baby Boomers, and has to die in me for me to succeed in this Code School effort. The kids are alright in that regard, jumping into Snapchat, Instagram, Tumblr,VinePinterestKikPeriscopeTinderTwoo, all running together into one big social media experience. And, if my own kids are a fair barometer, they have mostly abandoned Facebook, which, today, is as stodgy as use of a computer mouse.

Facebook, the virtual invitation-only frathouse where uber cool, world-on-a-string Harvard undergrads went to play "Hot or Not" using purloined photos, really is no more. In barely a decade, Facebook has evolved into the social media Applebee's, where Baby Boomers go to meet up with long-lost college chums and coo over photos of our kids and pets and vacations. I probably don't want to know how many parents, like me, originally opened their Facebook accounts to keep track of their kids. Now my kids seldom use Facebook, except to keep track of me. It has business pages now. It keeps track of birthdays. And, as my OCS database project re-revealed, it has burial instructions for Baby Boomers.

I found the instructions in the web version of Facebook. There's a little down-arrow at the far right of the blue bar on your Facebook page. It's a drop down. Open the drop-down and find "Settings," then "Security," then near the bottom of the list is "Legacy Contact: Choose a family member or close friend to care for your account if something happens to you." When it is time for the Legacy Contact to act, Facebook will post "Remembering" above the account owner's name on their Facebook page. The Legacy Contact can pin a post to the top of the account owner's timeline, and download an archive of their posts. There may be other things the Legacy Contact can do, but you get the idea. 

So anyway, I can pick a Legacy Contact. Maybe I'll ask Steve Jackson, who, according to Facebook, lives on.

While we're all aware of the relatively little diversity within the tech world, I like to err on the side of optimism--that even if it did take a long time, the industry is changing for the better (better being more diverse). And it seems to be changing pretty quickly. This is evident even within the ranks of OCS--a friend of mine in budai has told me that there were only a handful of women in his class. Now, in OCS' fifth class, about a third of our class is composed of women. While we certainly haven't reached the same representation as in the general population, that's a really impressive growth for only a couple of years' time.

One of the starkest differences I saw in our resources for this journal was in the Verge article, in which I saw that 82% of leadership positions in the tech world are occupied by men, and that 65% of these same positions are held by "white" ethnicities, both of which are far above the representation in the general population. The Stack Overflow survey didn't include much information about ethnicity (if I remember correctly, at least) but it did show that hardly any women in development have worked in the industry for more than two years. So maybe (again, erring on the side of optimism here), the reason that there are so few women in management positions (and I'll assume the same for ethnic diversity too) is that because we're getting into the industry so much later than men, we just haven't gotten the experience yet that we need to reach the leadership ranks.

I'm very aware of the glass ceiling, not just for women, but for members of minorities of all types. I do like to think that this is improving, though, especially in an industry so modern and forward-thinking as that of technology. Hopefully, before too many years have passed, these numbers will much better represent society as a whole.

This is only sideline related to my main point, but the "ILookLikeAnEngineer" posts are really great--thanks for sharing them with us!

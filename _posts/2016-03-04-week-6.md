Week 6 was challenging, but in a different way than weeks past. This was the first time our class was introduced to partner project programming, in which only one of us was allowed to be working at a time, while the other partner observed and gave input. My experience overall wasn't bad, but there were lots of frustrating moments in which I felt like my input was being ignored, which I don't deal with well. It's tough to be the one who's not doing the typing.

The highlight of the week was successfully using an API for the first time. I still don't know if I'd be able to recreate the setup on my own, but it was such a good feeling when we finally got it to work. I'm glad to know tools like this exist (if I know where to look).

Having this weekend more or less free of homework was amazing. I feel like this is the first time I'll be showing up on Monday with a fresh brain. I needed this!

Week 4 was a breeze compared to week 3. I spent Monday-Wednesday working on (but never truly finishing) the swimming competition app. Thursday and Friday I worked on our new Binary Battle project, which is super small compared to the last assignment. It felt so nice to get the bulk of the main project without any major hitches--there were plenty of bugs, but I was able to find them myself and without murdering another portion of my code before realizing what was actually the problem. Friday we worked on unit test writing, and while I still have a long way to go before I enjoy writing tests, it went far better than our first go at TDD a couple of weeks ago. I still have some work to do on both projects, but overall, I'm happy. This is the first time I've felt confident in my abilities to write a decent program and to troubleshoot for myself. It's been a welcome relief after my emotional rollercoaster of a week 3!

title: Week 7 Update
---

Week 7 saw our introduction to Javascript and lessons about how it paired with HTML fits into the framework of the web. I found it fascinating and really enjoyed our toy problems, even if I was stressed about the quantity of them. Working this weekend on our first Javascript project is really neat, even if I feel like I've forgotten the basics of coding at times due to not really knowing what carries over from Ruby and what doesn't. 

Now that we're technically on the downhill side of Code School, I'm getting super anxious about the job search. There's a company downtown that I want to work for more than anything, but I get the feeling that they're highly competitive (and that it's a pre-requisite for working there to be really absurdly cool). 

I just want code school to be foreveeeeeeeerr.

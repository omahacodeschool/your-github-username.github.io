Name: Patrick Clark
Age: Born three years after the year in which Back to the Future was set.
Path: Embarking on a career and personal reinvention by attending Omaha Code School.
Overarching Belief System: I am reminded every February that I think humans were supposed to hibernate. We took a detour on the evolutionary path and the bears got the high ground. Consider the advantages: Go to sleep when the cold weather hits, then wake up in the spring thin, well rested and ready for the beach.

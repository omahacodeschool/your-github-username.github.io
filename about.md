My name is Ryan Newell (as the name of my blog kind of suggests). I've had the privelage of joining 17 other (awesome) students in an adventure in learning web development through Omaha Code School. 

My wife and I now have a 4 month old daughter named Elliana. She pretty much takes up all our time and energy these days (which, for me, will be reduced quite drastically for the next three months), but she is so worth it. 

When I'm not busy coding or spending time with our daughter, I enjoy playing guitar and reading books! 

I am very excited to see what new opportunites and experiences my journey through Omaha Code School will bring. See you on the other side!

### Who am I?

I'm usually confused because life is so vast and huge and beautiful and terrible while I'm so small and curious. But I try have fun with this bewilderment. It's almost as if it gives me room to breath, some space to move around and room to...well...make mistakes to put it quite bluntly. Of course, there are also days where things seem so grey and vague that I find myself wishing things were a little more defined.

Not quite one year ago, I decided to look into web development. Up to that point, I had never given it a thought. Well, maybe I did give it a thought... several thoughts here and there, in fact. But, whenever I thought about it, I immediately dismissed the idea. My thoughts on web development were along the lines of: _Well, programming languages, frameworks, and tech stacks are constantly changing,_ (which is totally accurate, by the way) _so why would I want to dive into something that I could probably never master or "figure out" entirely?_  Finally, one day it occurred to me that perhaps the ever-changing nature of programming and web development could be seen as a good thing in that is can help keep one on their toes. Perhaps it can even **help** level the playing field a little.

After that, I began checking out a few introductory courses about web development online and eventually decided to join Omaha Code School. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

## About Me

I have a daughter (six months old as I right this) and I'm crazy about her. I'm also crazy about my wife. My favorite things are the simple things. Nature. Hiking. Sunsets. Strumming on my guitar. Good food. Conversation with friends over a coffee or beer. Watching spring and summer storms roll in. Honest, down to earth people. 

I'm not sure as to how often I'll blog. It could be monthly, weekly, or daily. Either way, it's going to be fun to see how this goes.
